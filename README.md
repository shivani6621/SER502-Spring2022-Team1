## introduction
We have designed our language borrowing ideas from the Java programming language (and hence the name Mocha :D). However, we have also focused on eliminating some of the complexities in the Java programming language to make it easier for the programmer. For example: Instead of the complex System.out.print() statement we have a simple print statement which supports printing of literals and variables by separating them with a comma (,).
